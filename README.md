# Ethereum Wallet  

This project is a decentralized Ethereum wallet built using **smart contracts** on the Ethereum blockchain. It enables users to securely **store, send, and receive ETH and ERC-20 tokens** while maintaining full control over their private keys.  

## Features  
- **Decentralized & Secure** – No third-party involvement; everything is handled via smart contracts.  
- **Send & Receive ETH & Tokens** – Supports Ethereum transactions and ERC-20 token transfers.  
- **Smart Contract Integration** – Wallet functionalities are powered by Solidity-based smart contracts.  
- **Gas Fee Estimation** – Calculates transaction fees before sending.  
- **User-Friendly UI** – (If applicable) Built with a clean frontend using React/Vue/etc.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Solidity** – Smart contract development  
- **Web3.js / Ethers.js** – Blockchain interaction  
- **Node.js / Express** – (If applicable) Backend API for transaction handling  
- **React / Vue / Angular** – (If applicable) Frontend for wallet UI  

## Setup  
1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ethereum-wallet.git  
   cd ethereum-wallet
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Deploy smart contract (Replace with actual commands):  
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
   ```
4. Run the application:  
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```  

## Smart Contract Overview  
The wallet contract handles:  
- **Storing user balances**  
- **Sending and receiving transactions**  
- **Security measures like multi-signature support (if implemented)**  

## Future Enhancements  
- **NFT support**  
- **Multi-chain compatibility**  
- **Better UI/UX improvements**
